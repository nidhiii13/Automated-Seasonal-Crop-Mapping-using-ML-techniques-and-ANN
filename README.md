In a global scenario still affected by severe income distribution imbalances and chronic famine in several communities, the accurate classification of cropland pieces is of utmost strategic and economic importance. Crop maps play an important role in various applications such as crop inventories, crop insurance, yield estimation and the enforcement of quota limits.

Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been reliable tools in remote crop mapping. Remote sensors like radiometers and radars positioned in unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites enable a continuous, high quality, relatively reduced cost monitoring of the Earth surface use by agriculture, addressing specific issues inherent to the problem, like for example the dynamic changes of crop characteristics and growing stages over time.
As the amount and complexity of data gathered from such different sources over several time spans is inherently huge, machine learning plays a central role when it comes to the final classification purpose.

Machine learning has emerged as a new way of computation for handling and manipulation of data of huge magnitude. Classification approach has been proven highly efficient and accurate for purposes of segregation, categorizing, recognition and identification of data of various kinds. Hence, many machine learning algorithms like decision trees, Random Forest classification and even Neural networks have been developed for classification of crops based on the satellite images.
